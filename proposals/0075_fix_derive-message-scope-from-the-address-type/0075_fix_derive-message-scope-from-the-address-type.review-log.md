## 11. What the 2026-09-06 rewrites changed

Recorded so a reader who saw an earlier revision can tell what moved and why.

**The first rewrite** answered proposal 0076's assessment of this document, which is the only place 0076
states anything about another proposal's validity.

- **The central argument.** The earlier revision grounded its exception on the handler mutating a pod-wide
  `coordinationState`, so that "the identifier selects nothing". 0076's CODE-1 deletes that state. §1.2 now
  states the ground as the specification's rather than the tree's, and states that 0076 removes it.
- **The dependency was corrected.** §10 previously called the proposals independent and the collision a
  rebase.
- **The non-goal was corrected.** A bullet describing the pod-wide counter as 0076's subject described
  state that no longer exists after 0076.
- **Anchors were refreshed** against the tree: `SessionId` at `schemas/lenny-adapter.proto:589` rather than
  `:580`, `CoordinatorFenceRequest` at `:1447-1448` rather than `:1403-1404`, `CheckpointRequest` at
  `:1166` rather than `:1131`, and `s.coord` at `pkg/adapter/server.go:302` rather than `:304`. The §1.1
  message counts were re-derived from the current proto and are unchanged.

**The second rewrite** applied the reviewer's answer to 0076's OD3.

- **SCHEMA-1, CODE-1, and DOCS-1 were dropped.** They carried an exception that the OD3 answer removes. D4
  records why the guard wrapper is gone rather than deferred, since it was the earlier revision's central
  mechanism. With them go the proto, generated-code, handler, gateway-caller, and reader-facing-page edit
  sites, and tiers 1 and 3 for the rename.
- **The conditional framing was removed.** An intermediate revision made three deliverables conditional on
  OD3 and added a gate step to the checklist; both are gone now that the answer exists.
- **SPEC-1 grew the three §4.1 sites** at `:151`, `:175`, and `:188` that 0076's OD3 Question B assigns to
  a successor, because this proposal is that successor.
- **TEST-2 is new.** The false tier-3 coverage clause was a defect 0076 recorded and left conditional on
  OD3. Under the answer given it is an edit site of this proposal rather than a separate finding, and §4
  records the one point it must settle.
- **§7 lost two questions and gained one.** The guard type's name and the wrapper-versus-bare-string choice
  went with D4. The retired-field-number column arrived with TEST-2.
