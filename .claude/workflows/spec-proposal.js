(2) Trust boundary and durability of a security bound — for every value that bounds a security property (residual-state limits such as maxTasksPerPod/maxScrubFailures, quota/budget ceilings, isolation or reuse counters), verify the AUTHORITATIVE source is a trusted component, not an in-pod or otherwise attacker-influenceable self-report: the spec's proxy-mode posture (the gateway measures independently and ignores the pod's self-report in multi-tenant deployments) is the bar, and a bound sourced from a pod self-report, or one that can silently RESET or relax on a store outage because it lacks the durable fallback section 12.4 requires of every Redis-backed role, is a finding.

Hunt for per-unit-of-work write amplification onto etcd, single-leader or single-key serialization bottlenecks, hot keys, informer-cache memory for net-new watches, and reconcile or work-queue pressure; state the math. Then test failure-mode reliability: trace what survives and what stalls during a Postgres failover, a Redis reset, and a gateway coordinator handoff, and confirm the binding, occupancy, running work, and any security-bounding counter survive or degrade no worse than the shipped design and that every store-backed value the design relies on has a durable fallback (section 12.4).

A change to one representation that is not mirrored in its parallels is a finding: a REST field missing from the OpenAPI document, the MCP tool schema, an SDK language, or the docs; a wire, proto, or JSONL change that omits a language SDK or its tier-3 contract test; a removed or renamed client-facing field still advertised by the served schema, an SDK, a CRD, or a doc; an enum or error-code value clients consume changed without every emitter and consumer updated. Also enforce the origin rule: a name an external standard defines (the MCP or A2A Task primitive and the protocol vocabulary clients interact with) must not be renamed, while Lenny-defined client surfaces may change; a rename that breaks the standard-aligned surface, or that leaves one client vocabulary half-renamed across representations, is a finding. The platform is pre-deployment with no backward-compatibility shims, so a deliberate, complete breaking change is not itself a finding; an incomplete or inconsistent client-facing change, or an internal surface changed while a parallel client surface still serves the old contract, is.",
